# Celsius Energy — Scroll Experience

A cinematic, scroll-driven landing page for the **Celsius Energy** drink brand, built as a front-end showcase of advanced GSAP animation, pinned sections, and clip-path reveals. Every section is choreographed to the scrollbar: titles wipe in, cans slide through a horizontal slider, videos pin and play, and a fluid "drip" mask transitions between sections.

## Highlights

- **Animated preloader** — a full-screen loader reveals the Celsius logo via a `clip-path` wipe synced to a 0→100% counter and progress bar, then fades out and gates the site render until loading completes (`src/components/Loader.jsx`).
- **Scroll-choreographed storytelling** — each section is timed to scroll progress with GSAP `ScrollTrigger` (`scrub`, pinning, and timeline reveals).
- **Clip-path title reveals** — headlines wipe into view with animated `clip-path` polygons for a premium editorial feel.
- **Horizontal flavor slider** — product cans scroll sideways while the page scrolls vertically, with splash artwork using `mix-blend-mode`.
- **Pinned video sections** — hero and testimonial videos pin to the viewport and play/pause on interaction.
- **Drip mask transitions** — PNG `mask-image` "drip" dividers melt one section into the next.
- **Responsive by design** — `react-responsive` plus Tailwind breakpoints adapt layouts and animation timing from mobile to 2XL.
- **Cohesive design system** — a single brand palette and neutral scale exposed as Tailwind v4 `@theme` tokens, with WCAG-AA contrast on interactive elements.

### Section flow

The page is composed top-to-bottom in `src/App.jsx`:

`Loader → (NavBar → Hero → Message → Flavor → CategoryBar → Nutrition → Benefit → Testimonial → Footer)`

The `Loader` renders first and holds back the rest of the page; once its GSAP timeline finishes it flips a `loading` flag in `App.jsx`, which then mounts the sections and refreshes `ScrollTrigger`.

Each section owns its own GSAP timeline via the `useGSAP` hook, so animations are scoped and cleaned up automatically on unmount.

## Design System

The brand palette and neutral scale are centralized as Tailwind v4 tokens in `src/index.css` (`@theme`), so every color is referenced once and cascades everywhere.

| Token                       | Value     | Usage                          |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `--color-celsius-orange`    | `#ff9933` | Neon Carrot — primary accent   |
| `--color-celsius-red`       | `#cb3133` | Persian Red — CTAs, highlights |
| `--color-celsius-black`     | `#231f20` | Thunder — all dark surfaces    |
| `--color-celsius-white`     | `#ffffff` | Light surfaces, text on dark   |
| `--color-celsius-cloud`     | `#f4f3f2` | Subtle light surfaces          |
| `--color-celsius-line`      | `#e4e2e1` | Hairline borders               |
| `--color-celsius-muted`     | `#9a9594` | Muted text / placeholders      |

Interactive elements use darker hover variants (`--color-celsius-orange-dark`, `--color-celsius-red-dark`), and text-on-orange uses the dark brand color to stay above the WCAG-AA contrast threshold.

## Deployment

This is a static Vite build — `npm run build` outputs to `/dist`, deployable to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or any static host. If hosting under a sub-path, set the `base` option in `vite.config.js` (asset paths already resolve through `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`).
